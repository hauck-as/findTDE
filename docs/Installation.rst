Installation
============

Automatic installation is available with ``pip install findtde``. The files may also be either downloaded manually or using ``git clone``.

We recommend creating a virtual environment through Conda first, then installing ``findTDE``. If you plan to use ``LAMMPS`` to perform calculations, you can install ``LAMMPS`` in the same environment with Conda.
